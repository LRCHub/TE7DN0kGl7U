something in the sky's
been burning
something in the water's
churning
it's time to bite your tongue
and run and hide
the end's arrived
they don't want your body
they're coming for your mind
they're taking everybody
eating them alive
they're not zombies
they're toxified
the hills have eyes
it's coming to ruin everything
coming from you and onto me
spreading 'till it's on
everything
everything
it's radioactive
living in a world of crazy
it's over reactive
growing like a plague
you can't see
and there's a meltdown coming
the whole thing's turning
narcisistic
everyone's sick
toksik
they got the fools on parade
again
with all the tools and the
charlatans
marching into the lion’s den
to repent for their
original sins
earth to idiocracy
the toxic cloud is mushrooming
and you're all in the zone of
the blast
is anyone listening?
the dummys keep doubling
it's reaching hypocritical mass
and it's radioactive
living in a world of crazy
it's over reactive
growing like a plague
you can't see
and there's a meltdown coming
the whole thing's turning
narcisistic
everyone's sick
toksik
boomers and zoomers and fascists
and groomers
and commie consumers and lions
and tigers and bears
oh my! oh my!
dunning and kruger are your
real abusers
cause you are a product
and I say it's buyer beware
hands over eyes!
I think that they have you
so afraid
you say what they think
you don't really think
what they say
keep them at bay!
killed off religion and made up
a new one
where no one can question at all
if its ever your fault
hey, what's that called?
I can't recall...
oh, yeah...you're in a cult!
it's radioactive
living in a world of crazy
it's over reactive
growing like a plague
you can't see
and there's a meltdown coming
the whole thing's turning
narcisistic
everyone's sick
toksik
