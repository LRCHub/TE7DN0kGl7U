[00:01.73] Something in the sky's been burning
[00:04.61] Something in the water's churning
[00:07.38] It's time to bite your tongue and run and hide
[00:10.82] The end's arrived
[00:13.11] They don't want your body
[00:15.83] They're taking everybody
[00:18.71] They're not zombies, they're toxified
[00:22.11] The hills have eyes
[00:31.61] 
[00:23.51] It's coming to ruin everything
[00:26.56] Coming from you and onto me
[00:29.39] Spreading till it's on everything
[00:32.18] Everything
[00:37.18] 
[00:34.21] It's radioactive
[00:37.08] Living in a world of crazy
[00:39.86] It's overreactive
[00:42.73] Growing like a plague you can't see
[00:45.82] And there's a meltdown coming
[00:48.93] The whole thing's turning
[00:51.84] Narcissistic
[00:54.76] Everyone's sick
[00:56.88] TokSik
[00:59.88] 
[01:02.49] TokSik
[01:05.49] 
[01:08.42] They got the fools on parade again
[01:11.19] With all the tools and the charlatans
[01:14.15] Marching into the lion's den
[01:16.97] To repent for their original sins
[01:20.17] Earth to idiocracy, the toxic cloud is mushrooming
[01:22.90] And you're all in the zone of the blast
[01:25.72] Is anyone listening? The dummies keep doubling
[01:28.59] It's reaching hypocritical mass
[01:44.09] 
[01:30.45] And it's radioactive
[01:32.25] Radioactive
[01:33.59] Living in a world of crazy
[01:36.32] It's overreactive
[01:37.89] Overreactive
[01:39.24] Growing like a plague you can't see
[01:42.30] And there's a meltdown coming
[01:44.01] A meltdown coming
[01:45.47] The whole thing's turning
[01:46.83] The whole thing's turning
[01:48.35] Narcissistic
[01:51.24] Everyone's sick

[02:02.02] 
[02:16.57] Zoomers and boomers and fascists and groomers
[02:18.59] And commie consumers and lions and tigers and bears
[02:22.34] Dunning and Kruger, are your real abusers
[02:24.34] 'Cause you are a product and I say it's buyer beware
[02:28.00] I think that they have you so afraid
[02:29.88] You say what they think, you don't really think what they say
[02:33.64] Killed off religion and made up a new one
[02:35.60] Where no one can question at all if it's ever your fault
[02:38.56] Aye, what's that called? I can't recall
[02:40.57] Oh yeah, you're in a cult
[02:46.82] You're in a cult
[02:52.92] Oh
[02:58.12] You're in a cult
[03:01.10] In a cult
[03:05.60] 
[03:03.80] It's radioactive
[03:06.67] Living in a world of crazy
[03:09.50] It's overreactive
[03:12.35] Growing like a plague you can't see
[03:15.10] It's radioactive
[03:18.04] Living in a world of crazy
[03:20.79] It's overreactive
[03:23.72] Growing like a plague you can't see
[03:26.69] And there's a meltdown coming
[03:29.88] The whole thing's turning
[03:32.82] Narcissistic
[03:35.77] Everyone's sick
[03:37.84] TokSik
[03:40.84] 
[03:43.45] TokSik
[03:49.04] TokSik
